# vbMahjongg
This is the source code for an old Mahjongg Solitaire game that I wrote in Visual Basic which I provided as *freeware* which ran on Windows machines.

- *VBMahjongg.vbp* is the project file.
- The *clsMahjongg.cls* VB class file contains the main game logic.
  - The `ShuffleTiles()` function is very interesting to me. It's logic provides a quick way to shuffle the contents of an array. Rewriting the core logic of this function in other programming languages could be a very useful piece of code indeed!
